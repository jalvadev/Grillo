# Grillo
A simple grid system, just that.

Grillo is an abstraction layer of CSS Grid layout. You add containers by adding .container class and different type of columns using .column-[1-10] classes.

Each column you add inside a container will occupy different spaces and even rows adjusting to the width of the device.
